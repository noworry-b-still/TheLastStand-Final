/** @brief Check to see if the camera rendering the pixel is a mirror camera.
*
*	Mirror cameras can't properly do SSR cause they try to use the main
*  camera's depth texture, and rendering the SSR effect twice more (currently
*  one camera for each eye in the mirror) is extremely expensive. Thus we want
*  to stop the raymarch immediately if the shader is being rendered by a
*  mirror camera

/** @brief Dumb method of _Blurring the grabpass.
*
*  Normal cubemap style reflections simulate rough reflections by using lower
*  mipmap levels of the cubemap. Unfortunately, we can't get lower mip-maps
*  of a grab-pass (at least on the old unity render pipeline, in the HD
*  render pipeline the one pre-defined grabpass you get has mip levels).
*  Thus, in order to _Blur the grabpass texture I'm just sampling a bunch of
*  pixels in a square and averaging the color.
*
* @param uvs Uv coordinate of the pixel on grabpass.
* @param dim Width/height of the square of pixels to sample around uvs

*  compare to the the depth texture's value at that locaion. If the ray is
*  within _LRad of the depth buffer, reduce the fixed step size to 1/10
*  of the original value. If the depth in the depth texture is also smaller
*  than the rays current depth, reverse the direction. Repeat until the ray
*  is within _SRad of the depth texture or the maximum number of
*  iterations is exceeded. Additionally, the loop will be cut short if the
*  ray passes out of the camera's view.

*  @param rayDir Direction the ray is going, in world space
*  @param _LRad Distance above/below the depth texture the ray must be

*         Expressed in world-space units
*  @param _SRad Distance above/below the depth texture the ray must be
*         before it can be considered to have successfully intersected the
*         depth texture. World-space units.
*  @param _Step Initial (large) size of the steps the ray moves each
*         iteration before it gets within _LRad of the depth texture.
*         In world space coordinates/scale
*  @param noise Random noise added to offset the ray's starting position.
*         This dramatically helps to hide repeating artifacts from the ray-
*         marching process.
*  @param maxIterations The maximum number of times we can step the ray
*         before we give up.
*  @return The final xyz position of the ray, with the number of iterations
*          it took stored in the w component. If the function ran out of
*          iterations or the ray went off screen, the xyz will be (0,0,0).
